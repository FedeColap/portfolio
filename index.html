                    <p><span class="love"> I am a Front-end Developer </span> and recent graduate of the Full Stack Flex course at Thinkful coding bootcamp. </p>
                    <p><span class="love"> I believe in stubbornness and beauty. </span></p>
                    <p>I grew up in a lovely town in Italy, learned english, became a lawyer, obtain an MBA here in the United States, started an Administrative Assistant and finally approached the Wonderful Wide World of coding... doesn't make any logical sense, right? </p>
                    <p>Wrong. <br>
                    I believe you have to try many ways before figuring out your own path, what you really like. And then insist until you reach your goals.</p>
                    <p>I like learning new languages and put my fantasy at work. <span class="love"> I love creating aesthetic solutions for websites and see them come to life. </span> I constantly search for a balanced combination of colors and fluid structure of the webpage.</p>
